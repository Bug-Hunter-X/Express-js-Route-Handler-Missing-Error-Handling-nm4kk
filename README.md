# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers.  Specifically, it showcases a scenario where a database operation within a route handler lacks proper error handling.  This can lead to application crashes or the return of incomplete responses to the client.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data from a database.  Crucially, it omits error handling for the database operation. If the database query fails for any reason (e.g., network issues, database errors), the application will either crash or return a non-descriptive error message.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle potential database errors. It includes comprehensive error handling that gracefully handles failures, logs errors for debugging, and provides meaningful responses to the client.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies (assuming you have a suitable database setup).
3. Run `node bug.js`.  Simulate a database error (e.g., by temporarily disconnecting the database) to observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js`.  The improved handler will demonstrate how to correctly handle the error.

## Lessons Learned
Always handle potential errors within your Express.js route handlers, especially when interacting with external services like databases.  Proper error handling improves application stability and provides better feedback to users.
